   <h1>do you remember our story?</h1>
   <p>
    Once upon a time when God was managing the world, he ordered  angels to go to different planets and control the situation.</p>
    <p>One of the angles was supposed to visit the moon.</p>
    <p> When the angle was bussy with her work she suddenly saw a moonboy who was sitting alone and his eyes were closed.</p>
    <p> She was curious about what kind of creation he was. So she got close to the boy. The angle was so impressed by the boy that she didn’t realize there is just 30 cm space between them.</p>
    <p>She wanted to go back but it was late. The moonboy opened his black  and very special eyes.</p>
    <p>The girl that was shocked, tried to pull back but she got stuck by a stone and fell down.</p>
    <p>The boy stood and looked at the angle, who  beauty and  elegance had embraced her body and was conquered by the white light , surprisingly.</p>
    <p>He took her hands  and helped her to stay. The girl was shy but attracted by his grandeur and his rough and innocent eyes.</p>
    <p>After a few seconds of staring  the boy asked : which star are you belonging to?</p>
    <p>The girl didn’t answer; spread her wings and flew.</p>
    <p>Days passed. Moonboy was thinking about the beautiful girl.</p>
    <p>On the other side the girl was looking for a chance to come back to moon and visit the boy.</p>
    <p>Finally GOD gave the angel a mission to go to moon and announce the situation.</p>
    <p>The girl spread her wings happily and flew to the moon.</p>
    <p>But on her way she had a tragic accident. She was targeted by humans on the sky. Her wings got hurt ;fell to the earth and fainted.</p>
    <p>Years passed. The boy was waiting for the girl. He was looking for the angel on different stars in  the darkness of sky but he wasn’t able to find her.</p>
    <p>When the girl woke up, found herself born in a human body. she had family. And the white light was in her eyes around her pupil instead of her body.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately she lost her memory; so she knew herself as a human.</p>
    <p>The moonboy ,who wasted his years in wrong stars looking for her angle, was looking at the earth disappointingly. Suddenly  he saw a familiar light.</p>
    <p>But where did the light come from?</p>
    <p>The source of light was the girl’s eyes which became wet by a wrong human and were very shiny.</p>
    <p>Boy’s body trembled. And his black eyes filled by tears. He jumped to earth to see the angle one more time. And didn’t notice that he didn’t have wings so he wasn’t able to fly.</p>
    <p>When the moonboy was falling down he lost the light and thought everything is over.</p>
    <p>Closed his eyes on the world disappointingly and was ready to death.</p>
    <p>Unawares girl get back her superpowers ; saved the boy on the sky and put him on the earth safely.</p>
    <p>The girl that had lost her memory; stood in front of boy. They stared at each other’s black and white eyes. At that moment the girl ,who was tired of everyone and stared at the boy’s eyes, remembered all the seconds which she saw the boy as a unclear memory. She smiled and tears of joy appeared on her face.</p>
    <p>The moonboy couldn’t believe that his pretty angle has became a human but she is still pretty. He was crying too because he missed the angle.</p>
    <p>At the moment that they were both tired of everything they found each other and everything happened again.</p>
    <p>The girl wanted to rely on the boy and the boy wanted to rely on the girl to take a rest.</p>
    <p>It caused that they become close and understand each other.</p>
    <p>They fell in love and decided to stay together always.</p>
    <p>Their love deepened everyday and it still continues. </p>
    <p>The name of Moonboy was Shobeir and the name of beautiful Angel was Bahar. </p>
    <p>My Shobeir, My handsome Moonboy, our love started from the heaven and lasts till the heaven. </p>
    <p>It means I LOVE YOU to infinity, infinitively.</p>
