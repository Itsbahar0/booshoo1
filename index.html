    <p>
        it has been <br> <span>1 year</span> <br> that we are in a lovely relationship!
        <br>
        you give me the best moments of my life. whenever i am down you help me to stay.
       whenever i am upset you make me laugh. whenever i am disappointed you show me the light. whenever 
       i am tired you become my motivation. whenever i am in pain you become my painkiller.
       you are my bestfriend. you are the best person i could meet in the whole world. i am the most happy girl 
       because i have you in my life.<br> thank you for loving me. <br>
       are you ready to take a look at our relationship?
    </p>
